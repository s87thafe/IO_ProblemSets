Notes on the Poblem Set 1

Question 1: Linear Regression
1. straightforward
2. no solver, take derivative and solve "manually"
3. Check for heteroscedasticity first, if not use HC3 standard errors
4. Plot residuals on education, if not derive analytically
5. revise IV
6. see 5.

Question 2:
1. 
2. By assumption y > p_choclatebar: linearity
